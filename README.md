# Kali Linux desktop on the browser

This repository contains a Docker Compose application that runs single containers to provide a kali linux desktop on the browser.

![Screenshoot](.github/images/screenshoot.png)

# Description

This Docker Compose application includes the following containers:

- Kalilinux: A web server running NoVNC with Kali Linux Desktop environment.

Default password for this container is: kalilinux

# Requirements

To run this Docker Compose application, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose

# Usage
To start the Kali Linux desktop in a browser, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jhu-information-security-institute/netsec-kalilinux-docker.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```
    cd netsec-kalilinux-docker
    ```
3. Make a directory for bind mount and set your user to own it or have access permissions
   ```
   sudo mkdir /mnt/dockershared
   sudo chown <USER>:<USER> /mnt/dockershared
   ```
4. Optionally set environment variables for the environment:
    ```
    export USERNAME="student"
    export PASSWORD="netsec123"
    export KALISHELL="/bin/bash"
    export NOVNCPORT=8080
    export VNCPORT=5901
    export SSHPORT=2222
    ```
5. Build the required Docker image:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```
6. Start the containers:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will start all the containers, and you should be able to access the web application at http://localhost:8080/vnc.html

To stop the application, you can either press CTRL+C in the terminal window where you started the application or run the following command:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Running in Detached Mode

By default, when you run docker-compose up, the application will start in the foreground and log output will be displayed in the terminal window. If you want to run the application in the background, you can use the -d (or --detach) option. For example:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start all the containers in detached mode and return control to the terminal. You can use the docker-compose logs command to view the logs for the running containers.

To stop the application when running in detached mode, you can use the docker-compose down command. This will stop and remove all the containers, networks, and volumes associated with the application.

Note that when running in detached mode, you will not see any log output in the terminal window. You will need to use the docker-compose logs command to view the logs.

# Exposed Ports

This Docker Compose application exposes the following ports:

- 8080: A custom port used to access the web application (NoVNC) running in the Kalilinux container.

When you start the application using docker-compose up, these ports will be exposed on your local machine. You can access the web application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
